Contributing to QuCAT
**********************

You can submit pull requests `on our Github <https://github.com/qucat/qucat/>`_, or contact Mario if you want to bring big contributions to the project.

If you implement any new features in QuCAT, any new function should contain 
a docstring and some comments,
tests should be implemented to automatically verify your contribution,
and additional online documentation may be needed.
Tutorials to help in all these tasks can be found below
